# PySSMic

Project in TDT4290 Customer driven project. This is a python implementation of the CoSSMic project. The CoSSMic (Collaborating Smart Solar-powered Microgrid) is a proposed peer-to-peer microgrid system where neighbourhoods can buy and sell local green power.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Open your terminal and clone the github repo to the folder you want

```
git clone https://github.com/eskarpnes/PySSMic.git
```

2. Change directory to PySSMic and create a virtual environment called venv

```
cd pyssmic && python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Go activate the virtual environment and install requirements from requirements.txt

```
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should now have a working project locally

## Running the simulator

You can run the simulator from the rootfolder with

```
python index.py
```

Open your preferred browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8050/
